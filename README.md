This was part of my first internship's project to integrate the Thalmic Lab's Myo Armband into the Unity Game Engine. I haven't looked at the code in 3+ years, so do not judge me for it ðŸ˜…

# myo-unity-library
For easy control/use with the myo in Unity Game Engine.

# Class to make myo movement hopefully easier
 * TO USE:
 * 1. Create instance of MyoMovement with `MyoMovement myoMovement = new MyoMovement(myo);`
 * 2. In `Update()` of the object, call `myoMovement.Update();`
 * 3. Call by using `myMovement.*desiredFunction*()`
